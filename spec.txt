The task:
This is the Charity Dao website: http://www.charity-dao.org/

In the future, we want to have a section where anyone can pick a charitable cause to donate cryptocurrency to.
This interaction (transfer) can be done through Metamask.

Please build a clickable dummy of this section (HTML, JS, CSS or any frameworks you re familiar with),
where there are 3 or more Charity Projects (fictional or non-fictional) that users can donate to.

We will see how your design looks and how you handle the integration with the Metamask payment Gateway.

You will probably come across many challenges, so please do not hesitate to send me some questions throughout.

Deadline: Please have something ready to show and present (also with some uncompleted stuff
due to the challenges you had) by Monday 15th January next week.
